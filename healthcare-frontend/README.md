# Healthcare Frontend (Scaffold)

This is a polished React + Vite + Tailwind CSS frontend scaffold for a high-end healthcare product.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Initialize Tailwind (only if you need to re-generate files)
npx tailwindcss init -p

# 3. Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Files created in `src/` include components, pages, hooks, utils, and a Tailwind setup. The UI is built with modern gradients, glass cards, and responsive layout.

Next steps:
- Run `npm install` to fetch packages.
- Replace placeholder content and add integrations to your backend APIs.
- Add images and design assets in `public/assets`.
